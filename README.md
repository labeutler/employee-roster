# Employee-Roster

## Description

This app will allow you to be able to see a complete list of your employees, with the ability to sort them by employee, department or job title. You will also be able to add additional employees and provide their first and last name, title, department, their manager and their income. As well as, deleting employees that are no longer with you.  If needed, you can add additional departments.

By doing this project, I have learned how to use SQL to add databases and lists.  How to enter into and modify them.  As well as coding them through vscode and the command line.
